## Menu Page

The menu page provides a centralized location that helps the user navigate through the many different pages that the app presents. It is helping to promote some memory offloading from the user since the options are organized in one page view. 


## Prevention

This page was meant to be an informational resource that can be used to explain the importance of various preventative measures that should be used to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Each icon can then lead to more information about why specific measures are important to follow in order to prevent the spread.

## Feeling Sick

It is also important to help identify some of the symptoms that are associated with viral infection. This page is important to the app since it summarizes some of the important symptoms to look out for, in addition to serving as a resource through clickable icons to further information about each of the symptoms. 

## Pandemic Tracker

The pandemic tracker provides a mechanism to do contact tracing and help ensure that if someone that has been in close contact with the user becomes infected then they will be notified. This page also gives nation wide statistics about the spread of the virus so that the user can have better context about how rapidly it is spreading. 


## Find a Friend!

This page gives the user a convenient way to chat directly with their group of contacts while looking through the app. 

## Treatments 

Information about treatment options are important to understand in case users end up being infected. This is particularly important for the elderly since they are at a high risk of requiring treatment options. 


## Relevant Stats 

This page provides statistics about the spread of the virus within Canada and throughout the world by providing links to more in depth analysis through the icons shown. 


## Vaccine 

Another informational aspect about the app is the page that gives more in depth information about vaccine efficacy and distribution options. 

## Get Help!

This page is a resource tool to reach out to people for different forms of help, either medical care or by reaching out to volunteers within the neighborhood if the user is not able to go out and do something for themselves.
