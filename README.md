## Menu Page

The menu page provides a centralized location that helps the user navigate through the many different pages that the app presents. It is helping to promote some memory offloading from the user since the options are organized in one page view.

## Prevention

This page was meant to be an informational resource that can be used to explain the importance of various preventative measures that should be used to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Each icon can then lead to more information about why specific measures are important to follow in order to prevent the spread.

## Feeling Sick

## Pandemic Tracker

The pandemic tracker provides a mechanism to do contact tracing and help ensure that if someone that has been in close contact with the user becomes infected then they will be notified. This page also gives nation wide statistics about the spread of the virus so that the user can have better context about how rapidly it is spreading.
